# Advent of Code 2025

This repository contains Vikram Ravindran's solutions to the 2025 Advent of Code (AoC) problems, written in the [Racket programming language](https://racket-lang.org/).

Note that I try to solve each problem as quickly as possible, which means that these solutions are almost
certainly not the most compact, elegant or efficient.

## How to run the solutions for a given day
If you want to run the solutions for day NN, run the following command:

```shell
racket ./run.py dayNN [datafile]
```

This will execute the Racket file `days/dayNN.rkt`, using the data file specified in `[datafile]`.
If `[datafile]` is not specified, it will attempt to load data from the file `data/dayNN.txt`.


## So where are the datafiles?
The creator of Advent of Code has requested that participants not store AoC datafiles in public places. This is why I have not committed them to this repository.
